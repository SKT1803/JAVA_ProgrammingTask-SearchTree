# Inventory & Management Systems Using Binary Search Trees (JAVA)

This repository contains solutions to two data-structure-focused problems, implemented in **Java** using custom **Binary Search Trees**.  
No external libraries or `.jar` files were used — everything is built from scratch as per the assignment requirements.

---

## 💻 Technologies & Concepts

- Java (no external libraries)
- Custom Binary Search Tree implementation
- Object-Oriented Design
- Console-based interaction (sample input/output)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SKT1803/java-bst-projects.git
     cd java-bst-projects
   Navigate to each question's folder and compile:
     cd Q1_InventorySystem
     javac *.java
     java Main
   
     cd ../Q2_CaptainManagement
     javac *.java
     java Main
   ```

<h2>Q1:</h2>
In this task, you are expected to implement a simple Inventory Tracking System <b>using one of
the search trees.</b> You must use your own implementation of tree data structure by taking
inspiration from your textbook or web. You are not allowed to use any external library or .jar file.
<br>
<br>
In your implementation, for each product, you must keep ID, name and piece in tree data structure.
<br>
<br>
You should implement three basic operations for your systems, which are:
<br>
<br>
<or>
  <li>Create product</li>
  <li>Is the product available</li>
  <li>Quit</li>
</or>
<br>
<b>Create product:</b> In this function you should create product and store it in your search tree data
structure. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Is the product available: </b>This function, if the product is in stock, prints to the console how many
are left. If the product is not found, the message “ The product is out of stock!!!” must be displayed.
<br>
<br>
<b>Quit:</b> This function must stop your program.
<br>
<br>
<b>Example Input/Output:</b>
<br>
<br>
Inputs must be read from an input.txt file, not from the console but your output must appear in the
console. You can also find the input.txt file in the input folder.

  --------------- WELCOME TO ITS ---------------
Create Product:
                 ID: 23
                 Name: sweatshirt
                 Piece: 1
Create Product:
                 ID: 56
                 Name: skirt
                 Piece: 2
Create Product:
                 ID: 95
                 Name: hat
                 Piece: 6
  
There are 1 products
There are 2 products
The product is out of stock!!!
Thank you for using ITS, Good Bye!

<h2>Q2:</h2>
In this question, a chauffeur-driven rental company (CDRC) asks you to write a management
system code in java <b>using binary search trees</b> for their captain's salary increase. You must use
your own implementation of binary search trees by taking inspiration from your textbook or web.
You are not allowed to use any external library or .jar file.
<br>
<br>
These chauffeurs should be kept in a captain database. In this captain database, for each captain,
you should keep ID, name, available, and rating star.
<br>
<br>
In your implementation, you must keep the captain entries in a binary search tree by the ID of the
captain. No two captains have the same ID!
<br>
Your system will have the following functionalities; the details of these functionalities are given
below (see the end of this document for sample inputs/outputs):
<br>

<ol>
  <li>Add a captain</li> 
  <li>Delete the captain</li>
  <li> Print a captain’s information</li>
  <li>Print all captains’ information</li>
  <li> Rent a car</li>
  <li> Finish the ride</li>
  <li>Quit</li>
</ol>

<b>Add a captain:</b> This function generates a BST node for each captain in the tree. The function is
followed by two values: the captain ID and the captain’s name. The default value for the rating
stars will be “0” and the default value of available is “true”.
<br>
<br>
<b>Delete the captain: </b>This function has one value that represents the captain’s ID. The command
will search for this captain in the tree then remove his/her node from the BST, and it will output
the “The captain left CDRC” message. If the specified captain is not found, it will output the
“Couldn’t find any captain with ID number ” message.
<br>
<br>
<b>Print a captain’s information:</b> This function has one value which is the captain ID. It will output
the name and the rating stars for the specified captain. If the specified captain is not found, it will
output the “Couldn’t find any captain with ID number ” message.
<br>
<br>
<b>Print all captain’s information:</b> This function prints all captain's IDs, names, available, and
rating stars.
<br>
<br>
<b>Rent a car:</b> This function has one value which is the captain ID. The command will book a ride
with the specified captain by changing the available to “false”. If the available for the specified
captain is already “false”, then output the “The captain is not available. He is on another ride!”
message. If the specified captain is not found, it will output the “Couldn’t find any captain with
ID number ” message.
<br>
<br>
<b>Finish the ride:</b> This function has two value which is the captain ID, and the rider satisfaction (0
or 1). This command will make the specified captain available again by changing the available to
“true”. The rating stars will affect the captain rating stars. The rating stars will increase by one if
the rider is satisfied and decrease by one otherwise. (Note: the rating stars is a value between 0 and
5 only). If the available for the specified captain is already “true”, then output the “The captain is
not in a ride!” message. If the specified captain is not found, it will output the “Couldn’t find any
captain with ID number ” message.
<br>
<br>
<b>Quit:</b> This function must stop your program.
<br>
<br>
<b>Example Input/Output:</b>
<br>
<br>
Inputs must be read from an input.txt file, not from the console but your output must appear in the
console. You can also find the input.txt file in the input folder.
