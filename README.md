<h2>Q1:</h2>
In this task, you are expected to implement a simple Inventory Tracking System <b>using one of
the search trees.</b> You must use your own implementation of tree data structure by taking
inspiration from your textbook or web. You are not allowed to use any external library or .jar file.
<br>
<br>
In your implementation, for each product, you must keep ID, name and piece in tree data structure.
<br>
<br>
You should implement three basic operations for your systems, which are:
<br>
<br>
<or>
  <li>Create product</li>
  <li>Is the product available</li>
  <li>Quit</li>
</or>
<br>
<b>Create product:</b> In this function you should create product and store it in your search tree data
structure. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Is the product available: </b>This function, if the product is in stock, prints to the console how many
are left. If the product is not found, the message “ The product is out of stock!!!” must be displayed.
<br>
<br>
<b>Quit:</b> This function must stop your program.
<br>
<br>
<b>Example Input/Output:</b>
<br>
<br>
Inputs must be read from an input.txt file, not from the console but your output must appear in the
console. You can also find the input.txt file in the input folder.
